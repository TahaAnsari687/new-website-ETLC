        <h3>What Does English language Mean?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="para">
        <p>English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, whose speakers, called Anglophones,
            originated in early medieval England on the island of Great Britain English is either the official language
            or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states (such as India, Ireland, and Canada). In some other
            countries, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by
            law (such as in the United States and United Kingdom)




            English is a languageâ€”originally the language of the people of England. Today, English is the main language
            of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and more than
            fifty other countries. (Interestingly, until as recently as 2017 English was NOT the official language of
            the USA, although it had long been the official language of several US states.)

            Worldwide, there are over 400 million native speakers of English, and over one billion more people speak it
            as a second language. English is probably the third language in terms of number of native speakers (after
            Mandarin and Spanish); and probably the most widely spoken language on the planet taking into account native
            and non-native speakers.
